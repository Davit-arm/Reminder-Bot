### /add <info>,<deadline(mm-dd-yyy) - adds a new task and starts reminding everyday (by sending reminding messages) and stops when its past the deadline
### /see_tasks - shows you a list of tasks that are stored in the bot's  database
### /delete <info> - deletes a task by its info(description) from the bot's database
